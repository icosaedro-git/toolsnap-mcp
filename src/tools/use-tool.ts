 * This is a DEFINITION ONLY. The actual dispatch happens in src/mcp/server.ts
 * ("tools/call", right after validating toolName): it unwraps args.name/args
 * and re-enters the exact same account/x402/free-tool flow as a direct call,
 * so payment, first-call-free, analytics and the free path all apply
 * identically to the inner tool. run() below should never execute — it only
 * exists so use_tool satisfies the McpTool shape and fails loudly if it is
 * ever invoked through a path that bypassed the dispatcher unwrap.
